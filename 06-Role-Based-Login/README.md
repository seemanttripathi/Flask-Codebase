# Role-Based-Login
The above code is more for testing purposes rather than production uses.

We need 3 tings to operate here:
1. User
2. Roles
3. roles_users [a table contains id of User and Role]

To make things simpler, I have created a dummy file
Run the python app.py
open another terminal and execute python dummy.py once!
All the roles and users will be created
